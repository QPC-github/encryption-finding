    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG)</a> supports the pervasive use of strong end-to-end encryption for web communications. This includes the use of TLS for transport encryption as well as applications that enable user-to-user encryption.</p>

    <h2>Why the TAG Supports Strong Encryption</h2>

    <p>The web is an interoperable, open platform. A key reason it works is because people trust it. As stated in [[HTTPS]], the TAG strongly supports the use of HTTPS to assure users that the parties they're interacting with are really who they say they are, and that their communications have not been tampered with. Recent W3C specifications, such as [[POWER]] and [[UPGRADE]], seek to ease and encourage the path towards a fully encrypted web. This is crucial in light of recent end-user breaches of trust such as [[PERMACOOKIE]], a privacy violation by the network operator that would be impossible in an encrypted web. Likewise, attacks on credentials and other sensitive information such as demonstrated by [[FIRESHEEP]] are prevented by the ubiquitous use of TLS.</p>

    <p>Thanks to broadly available strong encryption, the World Wide Web has enabled an explosion of creativity and commerce, enabling millions of businesses and other organizations to maintain the user trust essential to their growth. This trust is fundamentally undermined by key escrow or deliberately weak encryption provisions.</p>

    <p>As other technical experts have written in [[KEYS]], it is impossible to build systems that can securely support "exceptional access" capabilities without breaking the trust guarantees of the web platform. Introducing such capabilities imposes known risks that far outweigh any hypothetical benefits.</p>
